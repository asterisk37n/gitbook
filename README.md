# Motivation {#motivation} 
"Could you develop this idea for me?", asked a student. One day, I was talking students. They have businness ideas and asked me to develop. I was not willing to take it at all. Furthermore, They didn't expect they have to pay more than a million to ask somebody to develop an app. I told them to study and develop themselves, but they said "it is very difficult for us", even they have not tried to study ever. Can you believe it? I have seen many students like them. I decided to change them.
