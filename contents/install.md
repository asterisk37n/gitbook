# 1. Install Anaconda
We install Python in this chapter. You do not have to go to Python website to install it. Try conda. It addresses dependency problem moe than pip. Especially when you are on Windows, conda enables you to install many libraies easily. Libraries are already built.

Go to [Anaconda Download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Install may take a while because it installs also many libraries for calculation, machine-learning and web framework. Do not forget to set a path if you are asked. Path can be added after installation manually, but it is easier to let it setup automatically.
