# Postscript
Without many helps, this book was not finished creating. I organized face-to-face lectures with this book in July, 2017 at Hongo, Tokyo. For attendances, thank you for comming. Also, thank you, Mr.Koga and Mr.Inoue for providing an office room. I hope they enjoyed lessons and you had a good time in following the material. I welcome any comments and questions.
